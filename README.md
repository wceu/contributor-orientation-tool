# contributor-orientation-tool
A WordPress plugin aiming to help new contributors decide which Make team(s) to contribute to or join at Contributor Day.

## Getting Started
Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

	npm install

You are done.

Please not that you need to have [webpack and webpack cli](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation) globally for ease of use.

### `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`

Use `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` for on–the–fly updates of your code (templates, js, css)...

### `npm run prod`

This will create a `dist` directory for project. **This directory represents distribution package** to zip and install on your WordPress site. 

## Directory Structure

Plese keep in mind that `dist` directory is rebuilt with each `npm dev`, `npm watch` or `npm prod` command.
